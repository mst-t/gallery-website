## Description
This is a single page application created using Angular(Angular4). Authentication function is implemented using Firebase.
I am currently using this application as my portfolio, so the function is restricted. 
After signing up or logging in, the user can add, change, or delete information temporarily. Changed data will not be saved. When you press Reset, the changed data will return to the initial state.

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.28.3.

## Live Demo


## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
